# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis

This project provides an exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset, which contains information on the passengers who were onboard the Titanic when it sank on April 15, 1912. The goal of the analysis is to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, and to gain insights into the factors that may have contributed to passenger survival.
